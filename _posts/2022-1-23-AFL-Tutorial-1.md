title: AFL Tutorial (Part-1)
---

This is my first going with fuzzing. I've always tinkered with the idea of doing fuzzing with AFL (Americal Fuzzing Lop) but never did once for serious.

This time i'm serious and I'm well, writing a blog. So I'm going to go with this. This is probably going to be short series. The compiler one is going to be the longshot one here. 

Until then, see you!
